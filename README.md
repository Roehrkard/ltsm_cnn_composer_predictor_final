# ltsm_cnn_composer_predictor_final
The primary objective of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can predict the composer of a given musical score accurately. The project aims to accomplish this objective by using two deep learning techniques: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
